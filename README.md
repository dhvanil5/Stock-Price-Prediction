# Stock Price Prediction

This repository presents a stock price prediction system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model is designed to analyze historical stock data and forecast future prices based on learned patterns. This project is ideal for educational purposes and as a foundational tool for further development in financial data science applications.

## Features

- Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
- Feature scaling with Scikit-learn
- LSTM model development using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation and visualization
- End-to-end pipeline for stock prediction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP archive.
2. Open `Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Execute the cells in order to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate predictions.

## Results

The model generates predicted stock prices plotted against actual values to visually assess performance. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used for accuracy assessment.
